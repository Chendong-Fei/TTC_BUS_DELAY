clean this data: fill all the blank space with NA, create a new target variable "delay"(if Min_delay >0, mark 1 otherwise, 0) delete min_delay and min_gap
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL·E
Here is the R code to clean the data as you requested. It assumes that the CSV file is named ttc-bus-delay-data-2024.csv.
R
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Set file path
file_path <- "ttc-bus-delay-data-2024.csv"

# Read the data
data <- read.csv(file_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Replace blank spaces with NA
data[data == ""] <- NA

# Create the new target variable "delay"
data <- data %>%
  mutate(delay = ifelse(Min_delay > 0, 1, 0))

# Remove the columns "Min_delay" and "Min_gap"
data <- data %>%
  select(-Min_delay, -Min_gap)

# Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file
write.csv(data, "ttc-bus-delay-data-2024-cleaned.csv", row.names = FALSE)

print("Data cleaning complete. Cleaned file saved as 'ttc-bus-delay-data-2024-cleaned.csv'.")
Instructions:
Save the provided script into an R script file (e.g., clean_data.R).
Run the script in an R environment where the CSV file is located.
The cleaned file will be saved as ttc-bus-delay-data-2024-cleaned.csv.

i want produce this graph show each variables as y-axis, and estimate coefficient as x-axis
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL·E
To produce a plot similar to the one shown, where each variable appears on the y-axis and the coefficient estimates (with confidence intervals) are on the x-axis, you can modify the code as follows:

Updated R Code:
r
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Logistic Regression: Predicting delay based on selected variables
logit_model <- glm(delay ~ Date + Time + Route + Direction + Day + Vehicle, 
                   data = data, 
                   family = "binomial")

# Extract coefficients and confidence intervals
coefficients_df <- tidy(logit_model, conf.int = TRUE)

# Exclude intercept for cleaner visualization
coefficients_df <- coefficients_df %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)")

# Plot coefficients with confidence intervals
ggplot(coefficients_df, aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), height = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Coefficient Estimates with Confidence Intervals",
       x = "Coefficient Estimate",
       y = "Predictor") +
  theme_minimal()

Can you give the code of Delay Distribution by Incident Type
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL·E
Here is the code:
data$delay <- as.factor(data$delay)  # Convert delay to a factor (binary: 0 or 1)
data$Incident <- as.factor(data$Incident)

# Generate the violin plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Incident, y = as.numeric(as.character(delay)))) +
  geom_violin(
    aes(fill = Incident),  # Add color for distinction
    scale = "width",       # Scale violin widths by group size
    alpha = 0.7            # Add transparency for aesthetics
  ) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.2,           # Add boxplot inside the violin
    outlier.shape = NA,    # Hide outliers to avoid overlap
    color = "black"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +        # Clean and professional theme
  labs(
    x = "Incident Type",
    y = "Delay"
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +  # Use a consistent color palette
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),  # Rotate x-axis labels and reduce size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),                         # Adjust y-axis font size
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11),                        # Adjust x-axis title font size
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),                        # Adjust y-axis title font size
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")            # Adjust title font size
  )

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P(y = 1|X)\): Probability of delay given the predictors.
    \item \(z\): Linear combination of the features (\(x_j\)) and coefficients (\(\beta_j\)).
    \item \(x_j\): Predictors derived from the dataset, such as \texttt{Route}, \texttt{Time}, \texttt{Day}, \texttt{Incident}, and \texttt{Direction}.
    \item \(\beta_0\): Intercept of the model, representing the baseline log-odds of delay when all predictors are 0.
    \item \(\beta_j\): Coefficient of the \(j\)-th predictor, representing its impact on the log-odds of delay.
\end{itemize}


$$
\hat{F}(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M \nu \cdot h_m(x),

$$ 


$$
P(y = 1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$


$$
z = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_j
$$


where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \hat{F}(x) \): The predicted log-odds of a delay (or probability after applying a sigmoid function).
    \item \( h_m(x) \): A weak learner (e.g., decision tree) added in the \( m \)-th iteration.
    \item \( \nu \): Learning rate, a small constant to control the contribution of each weak learner.
    \item \( M \): Total number of iterations (trees).
\end{itemize}
